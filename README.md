# InstagramWidget
A simple widget to show the latest post from a public Instagram profile. 

_Currently, it is not styled to make it easier for someone to add their own styles._

### To Use
Simply update the 'instagramUsername' variable on line 8 of main.js


#### Single page HTML option
To embed it via html, use EmbedInstagramWidget.html.
It is self contained all in that file, the name will still have to be updated on line 32.
